### Used Tech Stack
  
## Frontend
- React Framework
- CSS for styling

## Backend
- Node.js with Express.js for the Server
- JWT for authentication
- Postgresql and Sequelize as the Database

### Getting Started

## Frontend
- To start up the frontend, change directory into client folder and run:
```npm start```
- Following the example in .env.example, add your credentials to the .env file
## Backend
- To start the server, change directory into server folder and run:
```node seed```
- Then run
```nodemon --> starts the node express server```
- Following the example in .env.example, add your credentials to the .env file

node seed
index.js change force: from false to true if you want to wipe the data
## Database
- After starting the server, the database should be connected
- 

- Make sure you have Node.js installed on your local machine
- 'npm install' dependencies
- Update the .env files with your information
- Make sure you're connected to postgresql
  (you can use pgAdmin4 to visualize the data)
- Run the command 'node seed' in the server to autofill the database with seed data
- Then use the command 'nodemon' in the server folder to start the server
- And use the command 'npm start' in the client folder to open the page in the browser
